Deploying an Application on EKS Cluster with AWS Fargate and ALB
Overview:
I deployed an application on an Amazon EKS cluster using AWS Fargate, where workloads run without managing EC2 nodes. The application was exposed via an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB). Below is a structured approach to how I achieved this:

Prerequisites:
Before deployment, I ensured the required tools were installed:

AWS CLI â€“ to interact with AWS services

kubectl â€“ to manage Kubernetes clusters

eksctl â€“ to create and configure EKS clusters

Step-by-Step Deployment:
Provisioning the EKS Cluster:

Used eksctl to create an EKS cluster with Fargate as the compute layer.

Defined the necessary VPC and networking settings.

Creating a Fargate Profile:

Configured a Fargate profile to allow workloads in a specific Kubernetes namespace to run on AWS Fargate.

This ensures that workloads are scheduled on Fargate without needing EC2 nodes.

Deploying Application Resources:

Applied Kubernetes YAML manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.) to the designated namespace using kubectl apply.

Ensured all resources were correctly scheduled on Fargate.

Associating OIDC Provider with EKS Cluster:

Enabled IAM OIDC provider for the EKS cluster to allow IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA).

This step is crucial for fine-grained IAM permission management.

Setting Up ALB Controller Permissions:

Created an IAM policy for the ALB Ingress Controller.

Attached the policy to an IAM role and associated it with a Kubernetes service account (SA).

Installing ALB Ingress Controller:

Added the Helm repository for AWS Load Balancer Controller.

Installed and configured the controller to integrate with the EKS cluster.

Accessing the Application:

Verified that the ALB was correctly provisioned.

Retrieved the ALB DNS name and accessed the deployed application over the internet.

DevOpsified a GoLang app hosted on GitHub by setting up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS EKS.
===================================================================

Project Overview:
"I implemented a complete DevOps pipeline for a GoLang application, automating its deployment on AWS EKS using GitHub Actions, Helm, and ArgoCD. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step approach I followed:"

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Pre-requisites Setup
"I ensured all required tools were installed, including Git, Docker, AWS CLI, eksctl, kubectl, Helm, and ArgoCD."

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: EKS Cluster Deployment
"I provisioned an EKS cluster along with a node pool using eksctl to host the application."

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Application Testing & Containerization
"I first tested the GoLang application locally. Then, I containerized it using Docker and tested it again inside a container."

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Kubernetes Manifests for Deployment
"I wrote Kubernetes manifests for Deployment, Service, and Ingress to define how the application should be deployed, exposed, and accessed."

ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Deploying Kubernetes Manifests Manually
"I applied the Kubernetes manifests step by step using kubectl, without Helm, to validate that the application worked as expected."

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Testing via NodePort
"I exposed the application using NodePort and accessed it via the worker nodeâ€™s IP to ensure it's reachable."

ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Ingress Controller Setup
"To enable external access, I set up an Ingress NGINX Controller and validated application access via LoadBalancer and Network Load Balancer (NLB)."

ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Helm Chart Creation
"To simplify deployments, I converted the raw Kubernetes manifests into a Helm chart and packaged the application for better reusability and parameterization."

ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Deploying with Helm
"I used Helm to deploy all Kubernetes resources in a single command, making deployment easier and configurable."

sh
Copy
Edit
helm install go-web-app ./go-web-app-chart
ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Implementing CI with GitHub Actions
"I automated the CI pipeline using GitHub Actions. The workflow included:"
âœ… Build & Push Docker Image to Amazon ECR
âœ… Update the Helm values.yaml with RUN_ID as the new image tag
âœ… Push changes back to GitHub
âœ… Store AWS credentials & other secrets in GitHub repository secrets

ðŸ”¹ Step 11: ArgoCD Installation & Setup
"For automated continuous deployment, I installed ArgoCD and patched the secrets to configure access. I retrieved the login password by decoding ArgoCDâ€™s secret."

sh
Copy
Edit
kubectl get secret -n argocd argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode
ðŸ”¹ Step 12: Deploying with ArgoCD & Validating GitOps Workflow
"I created an application in ArgoCD to sync my Helm chart-based deployment with the Git repository. This ensured that any change pushed to GitHub would be automatically deployed via ArgoCD."

ðŸ”¹ Step 13: End-to-End CI/CD Validation
"Finally, I tested the complete CI/CD pipeline by pushing a code change to GitHub and verifying that:"
âœ… GitHub Actions builds & pushes the Docker image
âœ… ArgoCD detects the update & deploys the new version
âœ… The application is live with the latest changes

ðŸš€ Key Takeaways & Impact
Automated deployments with GitOps (Helm + ArgoCD)

CI/CD pipeline in GitHub Actions for seamless delivery

Scalable, reproducible, and fully automated infrastructure

ðŸŽ¤ Example Answer in an Interview:
"I DevOpsified a GoLang app hosted on GitHub by setting up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline with AWS EKS. First, I created the EKS cluster and tested the app locally before containerizing it. I deployed Kubernetes manifests manually and then optimized the deployment using Helm. Next, I integrated CI/CD using GitHub Actions to build, push, and update the image tag dynamically. Finally, I set up ArgoCD for GitOps-based automated deployments. This approach streamlined the deployment process, ensuring high availability, scalability, and repeatability."
